                        a major role in determining very accurate location.However, in Shiksha Setu app the geo-location capturing has
                        been made available in offline mode.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>	Whenever the AI detects a foreign object or a person while detecting the face of a particular teacher or student,
                        It shows "spoof detected".However in most cases, the enrollment of students were done without proper lighting, or
                        with multiple faces in the background or the picture was taken from very far away.Hence, it is advised to follow the enrollment guidelines,
                        so that these issues wont arise in the future

                    <p>	Sometimes because of the faulty enrollment of students, the AI faces difficulty to capture the faces of
                        certain students while taking group attendance.Hence , it is advised to find out the faulty enrollments and
                        re-enrol them.So that this issue gets resolved.

                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>	If the location error is above 750ms then the only possible solution is to re-capture the location
                        from Samsung tablet only and let the location settle in for 30-60 seconds before capturing it,after capturing 
                        the location it is advised to take the attendance in offline mode.
                        If the location error is below 750ms then the solution is to uninstall the application first, then install it again.
                        After installing, login ,then clear the apps data, and logout , then login again and capture the location again like
                        mentioned above, then take the attendance in offline mode.
